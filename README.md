# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data spanning from February 4, 2020, to April 13, 2022, using a combination of SQL, Excel, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The primary objective is to identify and understand trends related to the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. By leveraging data exploration techniques, we have determined the seven most prominent factors influencing the contraction of the virus.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language was employed to query and filter relevant data from the COVID-19 dataset.
  
- **Excel**: Microsoft Excel was used for data cleaning, transformation, and initial exploratory data analysis.
  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: This tool facilitated more advanced SQL queries, database management, and integration with external data sources.

## Data Period

The analysis covers the period from February 4, 2020, to April 13, 2022, offering a comprehensive view of the evolving trends in COVID-19 cases over time.

## Key Findings

After rigorous data analysis, we have identified seven prominent factors contributing to the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. These factors are crucial in understanding the dynamics of virus transmission and can aid in the development of targeted preventive measures. The detailed insights can be found in the project's documentation and analysis files.

## Repository Structure

- **`/SQL`**: Contains SQL scripts used for data extraction and analysis.
  
- **`/Excel`**: Includes Excel files used for data cleaning, transformation, and initial exploratory analysis.

## How to Replicate the Analysis

1. **Download the Dataset**: Obtain the COVID-19 dataset from a reliable source or use the provided dataset.

2. **Run SQL Scripts**: Execute the SQL scripts in the `/SQL` directory using your preferred database management system to perform data extraction and analysis.

3. **Explore Excel Files**: Review the Excel files in the `/Excel` directory to understand the steps taken in data cleaning and transformation.
